[Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/) is the platform that solves such data scenarios. It is the cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale.

Guzzle only supports ADF as an External job.
