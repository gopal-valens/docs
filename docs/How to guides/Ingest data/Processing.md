Processing

Processing in Guzzle is used  to transform ingested Data into a data lake (or target platform). This activity deals with complex processing logic by implementing all data transformation rules. 

Data Processing is the module which supports intra-ETL from staging to foundation and finally to analytics data tables. "Transforming data from one form to another" is the key purpose of the Data Processing module. Guzzleâ€™s processing module can read data from RDBMS, Hive, SQL server, Azure Synapse, other JDBC sources etc.

**Note:	As processing is meant for data movement between homogeneous sources and target, we cannot read data from source tables maintained in one technology and write it into target tables maintained in some other technology.**

  <tr>
    <td>Table+Filter</td>
    <td>Specify the table from where to read data. The table can contain schema or even database name. If you select Table as input, data flow fetches all the data from the table specified in the dataset. Also when the Table option is selected, you can also specify the Filter which needs to be included when querying data from synapse. We can specify record filters on the table if any. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Incremental</td>
    <td>This property is to control behavior of the framework generated column w_current_record_flag, in the cases where target is configured for merge operation. By default, when this property is unchecked, the source is considered a full dump. Hence all target records are first marked as w_current_record_flag is equal to N before performing the merge on target. In the next step, to merge primary keys that are present in source, this flag is again updated to Y and keys that are not present in source, this flag remains N. In case you check this property, source is considered incremental. Hence all target records are not marked as N for w_current_record_flag column.

    <td>Additional Columns</td>
    <td>Specify, if you want to map any additional framework generated columns or derived columns to the target table.

We need to enter the Column Name, Value and the Framework Generated Column. In the additional column section we will have the following Framework Generated Columns
w_created_business_ts
w_created_ts
w_refresh_ts
w_current_record_flag
w_eff_start_date_ts
w_eff_end_date_ts
w_sequence_key

# Example of the Processing Module:

**Source Table**

**Id , name, gender**

1, abc, male

2, xyz,  

**Target table**

**Id, name, gender**

0, aws, female

2, xyz, male

**Operation: merge**

**Merge_columns: gender**

Id, name, gender

0, aws, female

1, abc, male

2, xyz, male
